# SOLID
A demo project for understanding SOLID principles.

This project is a part of the blog [SOLID Principles](https://codedesignetc.com/2017/03/09/solid-principles-in-oops/).

SOLID principles or the "first five principles" of object-oriented programming were named by Robert C. Martin and define very helpful guidelines for designing maintainable, extendable and testable code. In this post we will go through each of the SOLID principles and discuss them in detail using an actual example.
